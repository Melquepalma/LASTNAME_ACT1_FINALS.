                <h2>Topic 1</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>All COVID-19 vaccine ingredients are safe. Nearly all the ingredients in COVID-19 vaccines are ingredients found in many foodsâ€”fats, sugars, and salts. The Moderna COVID-19 vaccine also contains a harmless piece of messenger RNA (mRNA). The COVID-19 mRNA teaches cells in the body how to create an effective immune response to the virus that causes COVID-19. This response helps protect you from getting sick with COVID-19 in the future. After the body produces an immune response, it discards all the vaccine ingredients, just as it would discard any substance that cells no longer need. This process is a part of normal body functioning. </p>
               <h2>Topic 2</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine is available under EUA as a two-dose primary series in individuals 18 years of age and older, as a third primary series dose for individuals 18 years of age and older who have been determined to have certain kinds of immunocompromise, and as a single booster dose in people 18 years of age and older. </p>
               <h2>Topic 3</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>The most commonly reported side effects, which typically lasted several days, were pain at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle pain, chills, joint pain, swollen lymph nodes in the same arm as the injection, nausea and vomiting, and fever. Of note, more people experienced these side effects after the second dose than after the first dose, so it is important for vaccination providers and recipients to expect that there may be some side effects after either dose, but even more so after the second dose.  </p>
